# Video Streaming Platform with DASH & HLS Support

## Slide 1: Project Overview
- A full-stack video streaming platform designed to deliver high-quality content with adaptive streaming
- Backend: Go (Gin framework) providing a robust, high-performance API service
- Frontend: React with DASH.js player for responsive, modern user interface
- Features adaptive bitrate streaming with DASH and HLS formats, allowing seamless playback on any device or network condition
- Supports video upload, processing, and playback with multi-resolution encoding for optimal viewing experience
- Developed to demonstrate modern video streaming technologies in a practical implementation

## Slide 2: System Architecture
- Go backend server (port 8080) handling API requests, file processing, and streaming
- React frontend application providing intuitive user interface for video management
- PostgreSQL database for video metadata storage including titles, descriptions, and technical information
- FFmpeg for video transcoding into multiple quality levels (360p, 720p, 1080p)
- Static file server for streaming media segments with efficient caching and delivery
- Microservice architecture allowing independent scaling of components based on demand

## Slide 3: Backend Components
- Video upload handler with multipart form support for reliable file transfers of any size
- FFmpeg integration for video processing with custom encoding profiles for optimal quality-to-size ratio
- DASH/HLS manifest generation with automatic adaptation to source content characteristics
- PostgreSQL database for metadata storage with efficient querying capabilities
- UUID-based video identification system ensuring unique and secure video references
- RESTful API endpoints for video management, status updates, and content delivery

## Slide 4: Frontend Components
- React application built with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- DASH.js media player integration with custom controls and monitoring features
- Adaptive streaming visualization showing real-time quality switches and buffer status
- Real-time playback statistics dashboard providing insights into streaming performance
- Simple video loading interface with drag-and-drop functionality and progress indicators
- Responsive design ensuring optimal viewing experience across desktop and mobile devices

## Slide 5: Video Processing Workflow
1. Client uploads video file through the web interface or API endpoint
2. Server generates unique video ID (UUID) and creates database entry for the new content
3. FFmpeg processes video into multiple qualities (360p, 720p, 1080p) with bitrate optimization
4. Creates DASH manifest (.mpd) and segment files (.m4s) with 6-second chunks for optimal streaming
5. Creates HLS playlist (.m3u8) and segment files (.ts) for Apple device compatibility
6. Metadata stored in PostgreSQL database including duration, resolutions, and technical specs
7. Client is notified when processing is complete and video is ready for playback

## Slide 6: Adaptive Streaming Features
- Multiple quality levels (360p, 720p, 1080p) encoded with optimized H.264 profiles
- Automatic bitrate adaptation based on network conditions using DASH.js ABR algorithms
- Buffer monitoring for smooth playback with configurable buffer thresholds (default: 15 seconds)
- Bandwidth estimation and quality switching with minimal interruption to viewer experience
- Frame rate optimization ensuring consistent playback even during network fluctuations
- Support for both DASH (for modern browsers) and HLS (for iOS devices) from the same source content
- Configurable adaptation logic allowing for quality preference vs. buffer stability customization

## Slide 7: Playback Analytics
- Real-time download speed tracking with historical graphs showing network performance
- Buffer level monitoring with visual indicators for remaining playback time
- Current bitrate display showing active quality level and available alternatives
- Dropped frames counter identifying potential performance issues
- Visual statistics dashboard with toggleable metrics for detailed analysis
- Session-based analytics storage for post-viewing performance review
- Network condition simulation tools for testing adaptive behavior

## Slide 8: Technology Stack
- Go 1.24.2 powering the backend with goroutines for efficient concurrent processing
- Gin web framework providing fast HTTP routing and middleware support
- React 19 with hooks and context API for state management
- DASH.js 5.0.1 with customized adaptive bitrate algorithms
- PostgreSQL for reliable and scalable metadata storage
- FFmpeg with custom compilation including AAC, H.264, and H.265 codecs
- Vite build system for rapid development and optimized deployment
- Docker containerization for consistent development and production environments

## Slide 9: Future Enhancements
- User authentication system with role-based access control for content management
- Video library management with categories, tags, and search functionality
- Analytics dashboard for content creators showing viewer engagement metrics
- Content protection (DRM) integration supporting Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay
- Mobile application support with native players for iOS and Android
- Live streaming capability with ultra-low latency (sub-3 second) delivery
- AI-powered content analysis for automatic metadata generation and scene detection
- Multi-CDN support for optimized global content delivery
